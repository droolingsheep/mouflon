The SET_ACTIVITY_WATCHER permission might be exactly what we need, but it's a signature permission.

Possibly the GET_TASKS permission will suffice.

Or the Logs permission. Activity Manager stores the launched activities in the system logs at level info under the tag ActivityManager

Current theory:
	Broadcast Receiver that gets the ACTION_SCREEN_ON intent and upon reception, it starts watching logs to see what happens. 
	
	Actually, all of the screen on and off events are in the logs. So we just wake up every once in a while and record the screen states and activities from the logs
	
	
Broadcast receiver for BOOT_COMPLETE sets an inexact hourly repeating alarm that will not wake the phone but starts up a service which stores the log
