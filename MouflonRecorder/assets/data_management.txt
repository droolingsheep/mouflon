This application collects and transmits the following information:
1) The date and time of each screen off and screen on event.
2) For each app launched:
	a) The date and time it is started
	b) The app name (component name)
	c) The general action to be performed by the app (action string)
	d) Additional information about the launch (categories)
3) The device model and Android version number
4) A random UUID is generated by this app per-device and is the only way the system tracks individual unless (users you give us your e-mail address).

This application does NOT collect:
1) Any URLs
2) Any usernames or passwords
3) Any phone numbers
4) Any other contact information unless you decide to enter your e-mail address

The goal of this research is to be able to distinguish the owner of the device from a foreign user based on these data.

All data is encrypted prior to transmission. During and after decryption of the transmission container, it is stored on an encrypted volume only accessible to the researchers working on this project

While on the device, data is stored in the app's private directory.
